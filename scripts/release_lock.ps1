<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Releases an advisory file lock for agent concurrency control.
.DESCRIPTION
    Deletes the .{filename}.lock file created by acquire_lock.ps1.
    If the lock file does not exist, emits a warning but exits successfully.

    Requires proof of ownership (O2): the caller must supply, via -Token or
    the LOCK_TOKEN environment variable, the same token acquire_lock.ps1
    returned on stdout at acquire time. Release refuses (non-zero exit,
    lock left in place) when the token is absent or does not match the
    recorded owner_digest, unless the operator supplies -Force. -Force
    breaks the lock unconditionally and is intended for operator use only
    (O3: these are advisory locks, not an adversarial security boundary).
.PARAMETER FilePath
    Path to the file to unlock, relative to the workspace root.
.PARAMETER Token
    The capability token returned by acquire_lock.ps1 at acquire time. Falls
    back to the LOCK_TOKEN environment variable when not supplied.
.PARAMETER Force
    Operator-only override: break the lock even without a matching token.
.PARAMETER WorkspaceRoot
    Optional (round-6 review, finding-6 parity). Anchors a RELATIVE FilePath
    to the given root instead of the process's current working directory,
    so a caller invoking acquire and release from two DIFFERENT working
    directories with the same documented workspace-relative path (e.g.
    "sub/file.txt") computes the SAME lock path in both cases. When
    omitted, relative paths continue to resolve against the process CWD
    exactly as before (no default root is derived and no root is
    required) -- this parameter is purely additive and does not change
    behaviour for any absolute-path invocation, or for any caller that
    does not supply it.

# from a different directory than the shell's current provider path
# reflects. In that common interactive case, GetFullPath would compute the
# lock path under the process's startup directory instead of the caller's
# actual current directory, report nothing to release, and leave the real
# lock behind. GetUnresolvedProviderPathFromPSPath is the PowerShell-native
# API for resolving a possibly-nonexistent path against $PWD and correctly
# reflects Set-Location, matching the same PWD-relative semantics
# release_lock.sh gets for free from the shell's own $PWD.

    #  2. Round-8 review fix: the path exists as a filesystem ENTRY (Test-
    #     Path reports true) but Get-AutoharnessRealPath still throws. This
    #     happens for a BROKEN symlink/reparse point -- one whose own
    #     recorded link target no longer exists. Test-Path on a reparse
    #     point reports the entry's own presence, not its target's, so a
    #     deleted-target symlink still reads as "exists" even though
    #     resolving through it (CreateFile/realpath) fails. Read the
    #     entry's OWN recorded link target instead (Get-Item only needs
    #     reparse-point metadata, not the target, so it works even when the
    #     target is gone) and recurse into resolving THAT path -- this is

    #     target was deleted. A recorded target that is itself relative is
    #     anchored against the symlink's own parent directory, matching how
    #     the filesystem itself would interpret it. A depth cap guards
    #     against a hand-crafted symlink cycle recursing indefinitely.
    #
    #  3. Neither the path nor its symlink metadata is available (a plain
    #     missing file, or nothing in the chain read succeeded) -- resolve
    #     as much of the PARENT chain as exists (H5 parity, round-6 fix)
