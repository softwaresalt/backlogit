# PR Lifecycle Skill

Manage the branch-to-merged workflow for a shipment or feature branch. This
skill creates or updates the pull request, responds to review feedback, keeps CI
healthy, and stops at the user merge gate unless the user explicitly approves
the merge.

## Purpose

Use this skill when implementation work is ready to move through pull request
execution. It centralizes the PR control loop so higher-level agents can treat
review, CI follow-up, and merge approval as one bounded workflow.

## Inputs

* `${input:branch}`: (Required) Branch name to ship
* `${input:title}`: (Optional) PR title override. When omitted, derive the
  title from the branch name or prepared PR description

## Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare the branch

1. Confirm the branch exists locally and is ready to push.
2. Gather or generate the PR title and body before calling GitHub tooling.
3. Push the branch if it is not already available on the remote.

### Step 2: Create or update the pull request

1. Use the GitHub CLI, such as `gh pr create` or `gh pr edit`, to create or
   refresh the pull request.
2. Capture the PR URL, branch, and base branch as the active shipment context.
3. Reuse an existing PR when the branch already has one instead of creating
   duplicates.

### Step 3: Handle Copilot and review feedback

1. Monitor PR review comments, especially Copilot review comments.
2. Apply bounded fixes directly when they are clearly actionable.
3. Re-run the relevant validation after each fix cycle.
4. Keep the PR description and review context aligned with the latest branch
   state.

### Step 4: Handle CI failures

1. If CI fails, invoke the `fix-ci` skill with the active PR or branch context.
2. Let `fix-ci` own the remediation loop for failing checks and unresolved
   review comments.
3. Return to PR monitoring once CI and review status are clean again.

### Step 5: Merge approval gate

1. When the PR is reviewable and checks are green, present the status to the
   user.
2. Wait for explicit user approval before any merge action.
3. Never auto-merge and never treat silence as approval.
4. If the user does not approve merge, leave the PR open and report the ready
   state.

### Step 6: Post-merge cleanup

After a user-approved merge:

1. Report the merge result and resulting default-branch state.
2. Delete the branch only when that cleanup is requested or already part of the
   chosen PR flow.
3. Summarize any follow-up items, release notes, or residual risks that remain
   after merge.

## Completion Criteria

The skill is complete only when one of these outcomes is explicit:

* the PR is open and ready, waiting on user merge approval
* the PR feedback and CI loop is blocked with a clear reason
* the PR was merged after explicit user approval
